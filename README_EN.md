## 🚀 Project Overview

**QADB** is a cross-platform ADB GUI tool built with **Jetpack Compose Multiplatform**, supporting **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

It is designed for Android developers, testers, Android TV / TV box debugging users, and advanced users who frequently use ADB commands. It turns common ADB workflows into a visual interface so you can debug devices, manage apps, inspect logs, take screenshots and recordings, run terminal commands, and simulate key events more efficiently.

If you often run commands like:

```bash
adb devices
adb install app.apk
adb shell pm clear package.name
adb shell am force-stop package.name
adb logcat
adb shell screencap
adb shell input keyevent 3
```

QADB can make these tasks much easier.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Device Management**: Detect USB / network ADB devices and quickly switch the current target device
- **Device Info**: View model, Android version, screen information, connection status, and more
- **App Management**: Install APKs, uninstall apps, clear data, force stop apps, and export APKs
- **Common Operations**: Reboot, shutdown, screenshot, screen recording, open settings, inspect current Activity, etc.
- **Key Event Simulation**: Quickly trigger common key events such as Back, Home, Menu, Volume, and D-pad keys
- **Built-in Terminal**: Run adb / shell commands directly inside the app
- **Log Viewer**: View and filter Logcat logs to troubleshoot runtime issues
- **Diagnostics**: Inspect Logcat and device processes together, including process search, sorting, and resource usage
- **Command Center**: Organize frequently used ADB commands into visual actions
- **AI Agent Beta**: Off by default; when enabled, provides device-operation assistance with human review
- **TV / Box Debugging**: Suitable for Android TV, set-top boxes, and system app debugging scenarios
- **Cross-Platform**: Built on Compose Multiplatform, supports Windows, macOS, and Linux

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Prepare ADB

QADB includes built-in ADB since v2.0.5 and works out of the box.

If you prefer your own ADB installation, you can configure a custom ADB path in Settings. Common sources include:

- Android Studio (usually includes ADB)
- Android SDK Platform Tools (standalone download)

To verify a custom ADB environment, run:

```bash
adb version
```

If you can see the ADB version output, your custom environment is ready.

---

### 2. Enable Device Debugging

On your Android device:

1. Open "Developer options"
2. Enable "USB debugging"
3. Connect the device via USB
4. Allow USB debugging authorization on the device

Then run:

```bash
adb devices
```

If the device list appears, the connection is successful.

---

### 3. Launch QADB

After opening QADB:

1. Select the current device
2. Check device status
3. Use common actions, app management, logs, terminal, and other features

---

## 🔌 Network ADB

If you need to connect Android TV, TV boxes, or LAN devices, you can use network ADB.

Common connection command:

```bash
adb connect 192.168.1.100:5555
```

After a successful connection, the device will appear in the QADB device list.

> The way to enable network ADB varies by device. Some devices require USB or system settings to enable wireless debugging first.

---

## 🛠️ Common Scenarios

### Android App Development

- Quickly install APKs
- Clear app data
- Force stop apps
- Inspect app logs
- View current Activity
- Take screenshots and recordings

### Android TV / TV Box Debugging

- Connect via network ADB
- Simulate remote control key events
- Install or uninstall APKs
- View system app information
- Debug settings pages or launcher/startup pages

### QA / Testing

- Quickly switch devices
- Execute common commands in batches
- View logs and screenshots
- Collect information quickly during issue reproduction

---

## ❓ FAQ

### 1. Why is my device not detected?

Please confirm:

- Built-in ADB is enabled, or your custom ADB path is configured correctly
- `adb devices` works in your terminal (when using custom ADB)
- USB debugging is enabled on the device
- USB debugging authorization is accepted on the device
- Your USB cable supports data transfer
- Windows users have installed the correct device drivers

---

### 2. Why does it say adb is not found?

Please check the current ADB source and path status in Settings. QADB prefers available built-in ADB. If you switch to custom ADB, make sure the configured path is valid.

You can run:

```bash
adb version
```

If the command is not found, install Android Platform Tools first, or switch back to QADB built-in ADB.

---

### 3. What should I do if macOS says the app cannot be opened?

If macOS cannot verify the developer, try:

1. Open "System Settings"
2. Go to "Privacy & Security"
3. Find the blocked prompt for QADB
4. Click "Open Anyway"

---

### 4. Does QADB include ADB?

QADB includes built-in ADB since v2.0.5 for out-of-the-box usage.

You can still switch to a custom ADB path in Settings when you need to use your system-installed tools.

---

### 5. Is Linux supported?

Yes. The release workflow produces `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.tar.gz` artifacts. Device mirroring still requires an available `scrcpy`; see the [download guide](./docs/download.md).
